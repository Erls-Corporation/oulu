h3 Introduction

p
	| This is 
	a(href='http://nodeknockout.com/teams/oulu',target='_blank') our Node Knockout entry
	| . It's basically a hosted web-based remote shell service. The browser 
	| client is just very simple IRC client. It could as well support uploading 
	| images and files to your remote server and other optional plugins.

p
	a(href='http://search.npmjs.org/#/icecapdjs',target='_blank') The icecapd(js) backends
	|  are run on local unix accounts that are created 
	| when first visiting the site. Linux knows about the accounts via nss-ldap 
	| – 
	a(href='http://ldapjs.org/',target='_blank') ldapjs
	|  – 
	a(href='https://github.com/cloudhead/cradle',target='_blank') couchdb.

p
	| Communication between the three main parts of the service are done mostly using
	a(href='http://socket.io/',target='_blank') Socket.IO
	| .
