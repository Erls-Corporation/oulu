A web IRC that doesn't suck
==========

# Abstract #

IRC doesn't go well with the web. IRC users want to be present at
their channels event when they are not online. Luckily there is
[icecap](http://icecap.irssi2.org/) IRC client that stays present in
IRC and provides a nice protocol for interfacing with IRC.

We'll design a frontend with all the web multimedia and pictures and
use icecap as the IRC backend.

# Motivation #

Oulu is the home of IRC.

IRC doesn't sit well in the modern internet ruled by the web but still
has a formidable user base. We don't want IRC to die away.
